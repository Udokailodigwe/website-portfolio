            I'm Udoka Ilodigwe, a Software Developer based in Helsinki, Finland. I have a background in
            education, both in research and instructional technology.
            <br>
            A former project assistant on an European Union research titled
            Inter-generational Learning Effect in the EU. I have also trained kids and adults both abled and non-abled
            ones on how to use assisstive technologies. <br>
            <br>
            I have garnered lots of experience in strategically observing and documenting the strengths and weaknesses
            of each trainee. I carefully analyze each documentation to find out their individual needs. With these needs
            in mind, i creatively craft individualistic instructional techniques to accommodate the learning styles
            and
            needs of each trainee.
            <br>I have always focused on delivering optimized instructions that target specific need, while ensuring
            full coverage of my target audience.
            <br>
            <strong>Communicating idea, knowledge</strong> as well as <strong>collaboration</strong> is also part of my
            strongest points.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently seeking for an opportunity to implement similar principles while developing products for
            users. I am always motivated to build products with full user
            accessibility and usability
            functions.
            <br>
            Hence, i am poised to join an excellent and inspiring team to ignite that spark and help me fufill my
            professional dream.
