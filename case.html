        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            udo_flix-API is a server-side application built with the combination of Node and Express for it's RESTull
            architectural state and NoSQL(MongoDB) to store data about
            movies, directors and genres.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
        <p>
            As a Software Developer, i struggled with the problem of developing from scratch a server-side application
            that i can connect with my client-side.
            I personally wanted to create an asynchronous, event-driven and highly scalable backend application
            that will serve client requests super fast.
        </p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            Implementing necessary tech-stacks to build out a full-stack project i can showcase on my portfolio. And
            assimilating the necessary knowledge from applying such tech-stack.
        </p>

    <div class=" case case_headings1">
        <h3>Processes</h3>
        <h4>Server-Side</h4>
        <p>
            To build a super fast, high scale and asynchronous app, it's quite typical i choose Node as against PHP or
            ASP for the Run Time Enviroment(RTE) during build. This was of course complimented with Terminal, IDE(VS
            code), modules(core, local and third party).
        </p>
        <p>
            In other to work with suitable framwork that compliment the nature of Node, i choose Express as against
            Django or Laravel, because it simplified Node syntax, and made it easier to write server-side code. Express
            provided
            me with minimalistic functionality by avoiding excess weight that will slow down server processing.
            For routing purpose, i used Express to manage HTTP requests that interacted with requests from client-side.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The HTTP(GET, POST, or PUT)
                requests to endpoints of the API was managed through Express.
                And middlewares such as morgan, body-parser etc. were adopted to log requests and read the body of HTTP
                requests within handlers.
                CRUD operations were used to
                manipulate
                data through the server to the database. And information from database were returned in JSON format.
            </p>
            <p> API endpoints were tested with Postman. I used Postman because it is a simple UI for testing API
                lifecycle.
                I also included user authentication and authorization code in the
                form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.

                For learning purposes i tried out Relational Database structure using PostgreSQL, i also created the
                database
                schema and the CRUD operations in SQL. <br>
                For comparison sake i further applied a Non-Relational
                Database(NoSQL) MongoDB, utilized it through Mongo Shell and further wrote CRUD operations in MongoDB.
                <br>
                For the Business Logic Layer, i used Mongoose as against Sequelize. This is because Mongoose is an
                Object
                Document Mapper(ODM) that fits and translates MongoDB document logic to the server.

            After completing the server-side, i proceeded with the development of a client-side so that users can
            practically request for and receive responses from the server-side. I built a single-page, responsive
            application with React.<br>
            <br>
            It provides several interface views, including but not limited to, a main
            view(showing lists of all movies), single movie view(show data about a single movie and allow users to
            add
            movies to their favorite list, a login view, registration view, and a profile view (where user can
            register
            and login into their account, and and also update their account.

            <h3 class="case_h1">Challenges and Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                Building udo_flix-API is the most challenging and also my favorite project. I faced Several difficulties
                while building this API server, such as discovering the best Business Logic Layer to implement and the
                best
                way to route the different endpoints of the server. <br>
                While i was using Node modules, i never knew i could adopt Express for routing the endpoints of the API,
                thus, making
                my
                code base clean and less redundant. Going through the <a class="doc_endpoint"
                    href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html">Express
                    Documentation</a>, i discovered how to use Express for routing the endpoints as against the use of
                URL
                and HTTP Node module combination, which requires much code writing.<br>
                To also make a decision on which database structure to use, i decided to try both the SQL and NoSQL
                architecture. At the end, i went for the NoSQL because my data appears to be unstructured and also
                implemented a document-store storage method and which would automatically be processed faster using
                MongoDB.
                Ofcourse, there were times when it seemed difficult to proceed and most installations were not
                working(especially Node installation and setting up the RTE for development), i had series of
                pair-programming sessions with my able mentor and tutor during i got all the necessary help i needed.

            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>
                The development of these projects took me 4-6weeks, this was because, lots of processes were going over
                my head at first, and i needed time to
                solidify the knowledge before moving ahead. Further refactoring went on afterwards.
